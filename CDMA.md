We'll use orthogonal vectors as an example:
- consider two orthogonal vectors j (0,1) and i (1,0)
- A wants to send 2 and B wants to send 3
- A is assigned vector j and B is assigned vector i
- A multiplies 2 by j to get (0,2)
- B multiplies 3 by i to get (3,0)
- These are combined during transmission to create the vector (3,2)
- The receiver wants to recover A's message, so performs the dot product of the received vector (3,2) with j
